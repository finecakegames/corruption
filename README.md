# Corruption
The game features action rogue-lite gameplay combined with survival elements
situated in a challenging post-apocalyptic fantasy world. The protagonist
finds themselves in an unforgiving world tainted by a mysterious and
ever-spreading Corruption.

Survivors of the apocalypse regularly venture on expeditions to scavenge
resources in the infected wastelands. These missions must be taken at night,
since it is the only time when a specific herb crucial for survival is harvestable.
With the sunlight, other dangers arise and thus they need to return back to
fortified encampments - the only sanctuary for those seeking refuge.
